# Chapter 0: Computers and Computing 
(Completion Time: 3 Weeks)

## Central Focus
Students will engage in real world problems to analyze and create algorithms. Students will also explore the role of computers in today?s society and how they pertain to developments other fields.

---

## a. Computers
_What makes a computer a computer? Discuss the common bonds that unify all those things, which we call computers. Also take a brief look at algorithms and the techniques used for solving problems._

### How to Launch the Lesson:

After watching the following videos, students can discuss in pairs or small groups what makes a device a computer. Start with a few math computations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and have students try to come up with a formal definition of computation.

### Activity: Computer or Not?
Have students discuss and/or debate whether or not a device is a computer or not. This can be used as an opportunity for collaboration. Divide students into two groups and have them come up with a persuasive defense to present to the class.

##### Materials:
1. Plethora of gadgets (some computers and some that are clearly not)
2. Devices that straddle the line to initiate conversation on the definition of a computer (e.g., a set of chemical pool water testing strips, a smoke detector, an analog clock)

---

## b. How Computers Work
_Take a look at the technical side about what's going on underneath the hood, so students are able to speak competently about it in conversations with others._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Have students make predictions of what happens when a button is pressed or the mouse is clicked on their computers. Then using an old, obsolete computer, show students key components of computers and discuss their role with the system.

---

## c. Bits and Bytes
_Data and storage on a computer all boils down to a fundamental unit of measure -- the bit, which can only take on two possible values. By combining bits into larger and larger groups we can become substantially more expressive._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Show students the development of memory storage. Some examples include floppy disks and zip disks which can be taken apart to show where things have been stored. More modern examples include CDs and external hard drives.

#### Demo: Storage
Describe that a bit represents one of two values (e.g. true or false, on or off). Elaborate on the physical size various units of storage might take up, all things being equal. For example, if a single bit were about the size of a single marble filled with water:

* 1 bit -- a marble full of water
* 1 byte -- 1/8 cup water
* 1 kilobyte -- 9 gallons of water
* 1 megabyte -- an above ground swimming pool full of water
* 1 gigabyte -- a football field sized-pool of water, three feet deep
* 1 terabyte -- a football field sized-pool of water, half a mile deep

## d. Hardware (Optional)
_Dive deeper into hardware and give students a consumer-oriented perspective on things to consider when we are purchasing or building their own machines._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Have students make a list of hardware that they have heard of, then using an old computer, disassemble and identify parts students have mentioned as well as parts they have not and discuss their purpose.

#### Activity: Tech Shopping
Discuss the specs of tech items on the market. For further analysis, break students into groups and give them all a ?budget? to buy a computer. Challenge them to see who can get the most bang for their buck. Have them defend their choices and sacrifices made to the rest of the class.

##### Materials:
Devices for researching new technologies

---

## e. Memory
_Understand the five major types of memory that are part of nearly every computer system are discussed -- hard disk drives (HDD), random-access memory (RAM), L2 and L1 cache, and the small bank of memory inside of a CPU._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Have students discuss memory specs of the devices that they use (i.e. iPhone, Android, MacBook Pro, etc.). Why are there two different numbers associated with memory? Have students predict what each might be and what information it stores.

---

## f. Binary
_An introduction of binary numbers showing analogies to the decimal number system with the purpose to not only introduce students to binary numbers, but also prepare them for encountering other number systems._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Review decimal system and the concept of place values, then show students the place values for the binary system. Discuss what patterns students notice. Using 5 sheets of paper with the following values: 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 flip some over and have students add the numbers to determine its decimal conversion. Then switch the game and give students decimal numbers to represent using the papers.

#### Activity: Binary Bulbs
Light the way for students to understand binary with some physical representation. Have individual students represent different place values and give them numbers to represent by simply turning their light on or off.

##### Materials:
Lights of sort (i.e. flashlights, light bulbs, lamps, etc.)

---

## g. ASCII
_A look at how binary numbers can represent characters and punctuation as well as the standardization of such values in ASCII._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Review binary system from previous model. In small groups have students discuss how a computer might represent letters or symbols if can only understand 0s and 1s. Compare different groups responses. Would ?a? be represented in the same way in all systems? Show students ASCII table and discuss standardization and patterns.

#### Activity: Crack the Code
In small groups have students write secret messages in ASCII (in decimal and/or binary) and have other groups try to crack them.

##### Materials:
Paper and pen or whiteboards

---

## h. Algorithms
_Learn to express algorithms using spoken or written language, and learn of the importance of defining algorithms precisely in order to have the desired effect(s) occur._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Have students recreate a simple line image based on instructions given by a student. Only the student giving directions is aloud to see the original image. Display different student examples to stress the importance of using specific terminology.

#### Demo: Phone Book
Show an example of linear search. Have students discuss with a partner or group what other algorithms could be both more efficient and correct. Discuss and demonstrate binary search while comparing it to linear search. Have students reflect on why the method of ripping the phone book is called binary search (e.g. what does binary search entail).

##### Materials:
Phone book

#### Activity: PB & J Sandwich Algorithm
Demonstrate the precision required for an algorithm to be carried out by a computer. Have one student record steps as a few student volunteers and a student teacher or principle execute the steps as literally as possible. Stop after 15-20 steps to discuss what went wrong and the importance of precision.

##### Materials:

1. bag of bread
2. peanut butter
3. jam
4. butter knife
5. plate

#### Activity: Creating Algorithms
Have students write an algorithm for completing some task they do every day. Have students submit their algorithms to you during class. If an interesting one comes up, ask two other students to volunteer. Have one follow the algorithm while the other is out of the room. Then have the second come in and execute the algorithm. Did the two executions play out identically?

#### Activity: Everyday Algorgithms in Real Life
Have students use their written assignment 0-2. Students should volunteer to demonstrate another student?s algorithm, to illustrate how quickly things can go off track. If a student turns in a particularly compelling algorithm (an interesting task), it may be worth bringing in materials so that the instructions can be carried out.

## The AP CSP Explore Task
The Explore Task falls is a written assignment between Chapters 0 and 1. Students investigate a technology of their choosingAt this point they have completed several writing assignments geared towards helping students find credible sources and guiding them through the researching process.
