# Chapter 1: Building Blocks of Programming 
(Completion Time: 4 Weeks)

## Central Focus

Students begin to apply computational thinking, learning to express ideas first in pseudocode, then a visual language, Scratch, and finally, a text based language, C. They are introduced to various programming elements, and begin writing basic programs with proper syntax.

---

## a. Pseudocode
_An introductions into express computational ideas in a language that can be translated to code. Used correctly, thinking in pseudocode may also help find bugs in your program before you even begin writing a single line of code!_

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Have students choose an algorithmic math procedure they know how to do (For example, solving the quadratic equation), and have them express the procedure in words. If there?s time, students can swap procedures and try to guess what the written procedure is supposed to do.

---

## b. Scratch
_Create your first program using a drag and drop block based language called Scratch, which will allow students to learn concepts without getting mired in syntax._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Because this topic is very specific, a teacher could introduce Scratch by having students play some games created in Scratch, either individually or as a class. The game used in lecture is: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/76196420/

---

## c. Syntax
_Moving away from a block-based language and more toward C, students will explore the details of how to express programming concepts in a text based language._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Prepare syntactically incorrect English sentences (missing punctuation, etc). Have students try to decode their meaning. Are there sentences that could mean more than one thing? Explain why computers cannot compile programs with incorrect syntax.

#### Demo: Error Checking
As David does in lecture, start with a simple but syntactically correct program. Then, add functionality to it but make syntax errors along the way, soliciting input from the class to fix them.

---

## d. Variables
_Develop an understanding of a variable as a container in which you can store things. Students will then be able to use and update their variables throughout the program._

### How to Launch the Lesson:

Run a demonstration where selected students try to sum up a number via one sheet of paper without talking. Invite around 4 students to the front, and draw a box on the whiteboard. The first student writes a value there. The other students write a number value on a sheet of paper. Have each student add their number to the number on the board, thus updating the variable.

---

## e. Data Types
_Every time students declare a variable they must bringing it into existence and specify its type. Students will explore the different variable types in C as well as the differences between static and dynamic typing._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Have students think of a list of how many types of data they think a computer can store. Likely, you'll end up with responses like pictures or videos which is an opportunity to revisit how bits and bytes store data.

---

## f. Operators
_Showing how we program arithmetic and assignment operations while noting the idiosyncrasies of left gets right where the expression x = 10 means x gets the value of 10._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Have students think about operations from math. Have them review the order of operations. Use examples of expressions with similar numbers and operations but different parentheses to show the importance of placement both in math and computer science alike.

---

## g. Boolean Expressions and Conditionals
_Conditional branching using Boolean expressions are how we as programmers make decisions in our programs. They empower us to take different forks in the road, allowing for different behaviors or different user experiences._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Have students articulate how they have their scratch programs make decisions. When have we decided the cat should meow? (Using a Boolean).

---

## h. Loops
_Instead of copying and pasting the same line(s) of code back-to-back, which can get clunky. All modern programming languages contain some variations on the construction of a loop, which permits iteration and repetition._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Have students list the most repetitive tasks they have to do in everyday life (for instance, folding each t-shirt, washing each dish, etc). Discuss when would loops be useful in a real-world context.

#### Activity: While Loops in Real Life
Have a student instruct another student to walk from one location to another location in the room. The challenge: You can only instruct one step at a time. Then, introduce loops and conditions, so that the statement "walk forward until you reach a wall" is valid.
