# Chapter 6: Problem Solving in an Interconnected World
(Completion Time: 5 Weeks)

## Central Focus
Students will explore different aspects of building multilayered web pages such as those that manage data and have a back end. They will apply their knowledge of C to implement logic in new languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Ajax.

## a. Python

#### Demo: Python Spell-Checker
Implementing a spell-checker in Python live in class can be a shocking and impactful demonstration, for those students who are familiar with the complexity of C's implementation. http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/7/w/src7w/mispellings/

## c. SQL
_SQL (the Structured Query Language) is a language that we can use to create, add to, select, modify, and delete information in connection with a database. By learning how to use SQL we can create a so-called "backend" for our websites, allowing us to store persistent user data (sort of like the notion of a FILE* in C) that we can access when necessary to improve the user experience on a page._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Open up phpMyAdmin in your IDE and demonstrate each of the basic operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) using the graphical tabs. Then repeat all of the basic operations only using the SQL tab to show the text based power, so students will be able to contemplate how they might access their databases programmatically.

## d. MVC
_MVC, or the Model-View-Controller paradigm, is a software design practice that separates code for a website into three parts: the model code, the view code, and the controller code. The model code deals with the data of the website, often performing operations that interact with a database. The controller code is the logic of the website: it contains code like loops and conditions. The view code is the aesthetic part of the website: it takes information provided by the controller and displays the page that the user ultimately sees when they visit the website._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Using an example website, have students in small groups break down the features of the site into three parts: model code, view code, controller code. The model code deals with the data of the website, often performing operations that interact with a database. The controller code is the logic of the website: it contains code like loops and conditions. The view code is the aesthetic part of the website: it takes information provided by the controller and displays the page that the user ultimately sees when they visit the website.

#### Demo: Website 3
Make a simple website using the MVC paradigm, or have your students do it themselves for practice.

## e. JavaScript
_Python gave us the opportunity to build dynamic websites, but JavaScript lets us take things even further, permitting client-side modifications to our web pages, making them more dynamic without requiring contact with a database or off-site server, which can greatly improve the user experience. In this module, students will get a very quick introduction to the basic power of JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM), which JavaScript is able to manipulate to literally change the contents of a website, albeit temporarily, in response to user interactions._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Show students side by side of C, Python, and JavaScript. Once again discuss similarities and differences. Maybe even using the inspect element in Chrome and changing some of the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to see live changes.

---

## f. Ajax
_Ajax (which formerly stood for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a web programming technique that lets us dynamically update the content of the web page. We can make snappier web pages that do not reload every time additional content is requested. Here, we see how this technique can be accomplished using Javascript, in which an HTTP request is made asynchronously (in the background) to the server, and a callback function handles the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object that is returned._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Take the time to explain Client side and Server side systems. Have students find some examples of both. What are benefits and disadvantages of both?

---

## g. Artificial Intelligence
_Artificial intelligence is an example of how Computer Science concepts can be used to create global impact. CS50's artificial intelligence material covers natural language processing, speech recognition, and game playing systems._

### How to Launch the Lesson:
Have students discuss preconceived notions of AIs in small groups. What is the difference between a clever algorithm and artificial intelligence? Discuss as a class which of these notions are correct and incorrect and explore why.

#### Activity: Eliza
Have students attempt to converse with Eliza: 

* [By compiling and running CS50's C code](http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/10/w/src10w/eliza.c.src). 
* [By using a web implementation](http://nlp-addiction.com/eliza/). 
* [By running a Java executable](http://chayden.net/eliza/Eliza.html).

#### Activity: A Problem with Machine Learning
Try to get your hands on a cheap device to turn your phone or mobile device into a means to watch VR video (such as google cardboard). You can even watch CS50 lectures in VR at video.cs50.net by changing the view mode in the bottom left corner. What fields might benefit from technologies like this?

## h. Virtual and Augmented Reality
_Virtual and augmented reality has recently taken the world by storm. Virtual reality allows a user to jump into a three dimensional world so to speak to experience games, videos and other simulations in a new way. This year CS50 has produced all lectures in VR. If you go to https://video.cs50.net/ and click on the icon that looks like a VR headset you will experience lecture as though you are in Sander's theatre. Augmented reality is similar in spirit to virtual reality, only that instead of taking you away from your surroundings completely, the effects, videos, or games are over layed to tie in your surroundings with the technology. In this module, students will explore the difference between the two and discover what advances can be made with this technology._

### The AP CSP Create Task

The Create Task comes in at the end of the core chapters, following Chapter 6. After completing Chapter 6, students have developed an entire toolbox of languages and platforms to build whatever they choose. While the majority of problems are very much structured and a have a well-defined solution, students engage a sense of creativity in the way that they implement their algorithms. Students understand that everyone may have a different approach to solving the same problem, but they could all be correct approaches. By the end of the course, students have dabbled in C and web development and have implemented algorithms to solve various problems. It is at this point that students are able to create a project that they are engaged in and are able to research new topics of interest that were not covered in-depth in the course.
