# CS50 AP Workshop 2017

## CS50 Curriculum

### Introductions
- All CS50 AP Workshop materials are on [cs50.ly/july-materials](cs50.ly/july-materials)
- Doug Lloyd introduces himself and discusses his background with CS50.
  - Graduated from Harvard in 2009.
  - Took CS50 in fall of 2006.
  - Started as a Math major, but eventually switched to CS.
  - Joined CS50 as a TF during David Malan's first year teaching the class.
  - Went to Law School and was in solo practice.
  - Had more fun helping CS50 than practicing law, so came back to CS50 to help develop CS50 AP

### CS50 in a Box
- CS50 is highlighted by 3 core elements:
  - accessibility
    - Students come to class because its fun to be in class.
  - culture
    - Helps make students want to come to class, rather than feeling obligated to attend.
  - rigor
    - Make sure to match what CS50 does at the College level and not watering material down.
- 2 models for bringing CS50 to your school:
  - adopt
    - This means using CS50's materials as primary resources for your students.
      - Students watch CS50 lectures, shorts, and work on CS50 problem sets.
      - The teacher's role is to circulate amongst students and helping them debug problems.
      - It's a flipped model.
  - adapt
    - Instead of having students watching CS50 lectures, teachers recreate them using the lectures as resources.
  - It's about a 50-50 split between teachers who adopt and adapt the curriculum.

### CS50 Tools
- grading tools
  - check50 - autogrades code for correctness/functionality
    - Students can run 6-10 tests written by CS50 staff to check the correctness of their program.
    - CS50 also uses check50 to grade for correctness, so students can know what to expect.
    - You can override grades in the case of corner cases.
    - Will run automatically and populate student gradebooks when a student runs submit50.
  - style50 - autogrades code for consistency with [CS50 style guide](https://manual.cs50.net/style)
    - Makes sure students are adhering to consistent style, which makes the teacher's job easier.
  - render50 - for generation of syntax-highlighted PDFs of student code
    - If you prefer writing on students code when grading, this will makes nice PDFs for you to use.
  - Grading guidelines for each problem
    - Created about 35-40 additional problems for CS50 AP.
      - For each of these CS50 provides grading guidelines.
  - Gradescope
    - Makes it easier to grade paper quizzes.
    - Have a master version of the quiz.
    - Scan the master to create a PDF with custom bonding boxes for each question.
    - Then, scan in student quizzes.
    - You will able to grade quizzes and provide comments each question at a time.
    - Can save comments for repeated use.
    - Free for teachers.
  - CS50.me
    - Teacher and student hub.
      - As a student, you log in and see assignments and links to GitHub repository where teachers write comments on code.
      - As a teacher, you can create sections that students join.
        - You see all student assignments here, grade by student or problem, and provide comments on GitHub.
        - When you add a comment on GitHub, the owner (the student) gets a notification of the comment.
          - This can start a nice dialog.
- learning tools
  - CS50 IDE - integrated coding environment preconfigured for CS50
    - It is a virtual machine in the cloud.
      - As long as students have access to a browser, they can access their work.
      - Works with Chromebooks.
      - Free of charge, thanks to Cloud9.
    - Offers 5GB of storage and 1 GB of RAM.
    - If students continue to code, the IDE is a real development tool.
      - Students can install other packages than the default CS50 flavor of the IDE.
    - For students with no access to internet at home, they can download an offline version of the IDE using Docker.
      - They can sync back up to the online version of the IDE when they get to school.
  - [reference.cs50.net](reference.cs50.net)
    - This is a friendlier version of man pages.
      - Man refers to linux manual pages.

### AP Computer Science Principles Mission
- Get more students, particularly those not naturally drawn to computer science, interested in the field.
  - This is a mission shared by CS50.
  - Our goal as computer science teachers is to get students who otherwise wouldn't be interested in CS exposed to the field.
  - Computer science pervades every subject matter.
- CS A: 30k students in 2011-12, 60k students in 2016-17
- CSP: 50k students took multiple choice exam this past year
