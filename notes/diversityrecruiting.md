### Why Do You Want Students in Computer Science?
- Reasons to get students interested in CS:
  - There is a huge demand for CS skills.
  - Solving big problems requires people of all different backgrounds.
  - Helping students to think differently.

### Technology in Education
- Seymour Papert is the godfather of technology in education.
  - Logo programming, created Lego Mindstorms, ...
  - When you use technology you can only satisfy one side of the following triangle.

    <img src="triangle.png" alt="triangle" width="400">
    - serving the system
      - data analysis
    - serving the teacher
      - smartboards
      - learning management systems
    - serving the students
      - Give students the skills, training, and agency to be able to make something and participate in this world actively.
        - What teaching CS is about.

### Student Messaging
- Students get a lot of messaging on programming these days.
  - toys that help kids code
  - summer camps
  - listicles
  - articles
  - tv news
  - people talking about how cool it is to be a programmer
  - the prevalence of jobs
- To filter through all of this information, we need to focus on "Why" again.
- “The computer is incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. Man is unbelievably slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. The marriage of the two is a challenge and opportunity beyond imagination.”
  - The combination of tech and humanity is where the sweet spot is.
  - Technology is not neutral.
    - It elevates the person.
    - It can be an enabler or an accelerator.
  - This marriage is where the true motivation lies.

### History of Tools and Development
- As humans, we are able to develop tools (technology) that help us control our environment and solve problems.
- What we choose to do with technology determines what will happen next.
- “If you can’t open or alter it, you don’t own it.” - Bob McIntosh, MidPacific School, Honolulu, HI
  - Why learn CS?
    - "... to function in a world where if my thermostat breaks, I can open it, kinda look at it, and not be subjected to whoever decides comes in and charges me $500 to (fix it)."
    - Becoming empowered by experience to be an active participant in the world.

#### History of Programming
- Stories about women in tech such as Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper are motivating to some people but not all.
  - Jolina states that they are great achievements but is not sure how they apply to her.
  - What's more galvanizing to Jolina is learning about subjugation of women in CS.

### Fighting Subjugation
- "Programmers master a system they know they can change." - Deborah Meier
  - Giving people agency prepares people to become active participants in our democracy.
  - Subjugation conditions people to be controlled.
    - Who do controlled students grow up to be? How do they vote?
- "The most important thing that we can infuse in the next generation is creativity and confidence" - Ayah Bdeir, littleBits founder and CEO.
  - Helping students explore and create things.
  - Developing creating thinking
  - These traits come from Computer Science principals.

### Looping Back to Why
- including people
  - The people who stand to gain the most from Computer Science are the ones:
    - being marginalized
    - being controlled
    - who have something to say
      - Which is everyone.

### CS50 at Archer
- Erin Harris transistions to talking about how CS50 is ran at Archer.
- The class make up of 8 students.
  - 5 seniors, 1 junior, 1 sophomore, and 1 freshman.
  - Only 2 students have no previous programming experience.
- The course is a science elective credit
  - Archer doesn't offer AP Sciences.
    - No students took the AP exam.
    - Allowed students to take the AP exam on their own if desired.
      - AP was not the main focus of the course.

#### Average Day at Archer
- Four to three 1-hour classes a week.
- Utilized a flip teaching model.
  - Students watch lecture at home.
  - Work on homework to introduce topics.
  - Lab time given to students in-class.
    - Every student has a laptop.
- Spend ~30 min of class introducing the new topic.
- Exit tickets for formative assessment.
- Work on problem sets in class.
- Office hours held 2x a week.
- Allowed students to resubmit problem sets.
  - At any point in the year, students could fix something and get 100%.
    - Helps build a culture of error.

#### Deviation from CS50 AP Curriculum
- In January, students were beginning to check out, so Erin elected to ask students what topics they would be interested in.
- After Chapter 4, we covered other topics including:
  - Arduino
  - Processing
  - HTML/CSS
  - Javascript
- One project had student create a robotic arm given art supplies, servos, and an Arduino.
  - Connected the project to the growing prosthetic industry.
    - Highlights that computer science can be related to other fields.

#### Things That Worked at Archer
- class/group problem solving
  - Students loved working on problems together.
- real-world problems
  - CS50 curriculum does a great job of focusing on real-world applications.
  - Girls think "Why are we learning this?" a lot.
    - Real-world problems get them engaged.
- allowing students to resubmit any assignment
- asking for feedback
  - Erin asks for feedback twice during the year.
  - For example, Erin asked her students about how they felt working on problems alone and they expressed interest in collaboration.

#### Things That Didn't Work
- asynchronous learning
  - This is especially true for girls.
    - They need to feel connected to their environment.
- not front loading pair programming
  - Students didn't know how to properly work on code together.
- CS50 AP culture hard to maintain
  - Events such as taking attendance and fire drills interrupt flow.

### CS at Archer

#### School Schedule

- 7-day rotating schedule
  - Students have 7 different classes that rotate to fill 5 periods each day.
  - X-Block are non-academic, creative opportunities to pursue something.

#### CS Sequence

<img src="archersequence.png" alt="archer sequence" width="600">

- Coding in 6th grade used to be a language course.
- In middle school, the students can look into Web, App, & Game Design or utilize the X-block to learn snippets of coding.
- Advanced CS = CS50
- AP CS A not offered on campus, but the students can take it thought One Schoolhouse, an online learning community for single sex education.
  - This is because the school is small and AP is no longer a focus at Archer.
    - ~500 students

#### Other CS Electives

- CS50 Hackathon is a bit grandiose for Archer.
- Collaborated with teachers from other schools.
  - There are a lot of schools in LA with motivated people.
  - Partnered with another school and opened the event up to all schools.
- 1 day event that culminates in a judged walkthrough.
  - 8 hours long
- Students in 9th-12th grade with any programming experience.
- Over 40 students came to the event.
- The focus of the hackathon was teen health.
  - Gave the students time to brainstorm and form ideas.
- Obtained sponsorships from SnapChat and other organizations.
