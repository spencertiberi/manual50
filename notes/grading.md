# CS50 AP Workshop 2017

## The CS50 AP Classroom

### Introductions
- David Malan discusses how the grading session will be conducted.

### Grading Overview
- CS50 evaluates code based on the three axis.
  - Correctness
    - most objective
    - `check50` evaluates Correctness
      - Ran automatically by `submit50`
        - These grades can be overwritten for corner cases.
  - Design
    - most qualitative and subjective
    - With large groups of students, grading for Design can be a daunting task.
  - Style
    - Like Correctness, Style has its own tool for evaluation, `style50`.
      - Also ran automatically by `submit50` and rewritable.
    - Based on the [CS50 Style Guide](https://manual.cs50.net/style)

### Grading Tools
- GitHub
  - Traditionally used in industry for code reviews,
  - Allows for more qualitative feedback on code.
  - When students submit their code using `submit50`, their code becomes accessible on GitHub,
    - You can add comments to any line of code by clicking the red checkmark next to the line.
      - Students will be notified via email of any new comments.
      - This process can create dialog.

### Academic Honesty
- _This course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as “be reasonable.”
- _... you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you._
  - Good rule of thumb.
- _Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs..._
  - Heuristic for whether something crosses the line.
  - "Let me see how you did it" is not okay.
- All academic honest problems reduce to making a poor split-second decision.
  - CS50 deals with this in a few ways.
    - regret clause
      - If you do cross the line and do something unreasonable, then come forward within 72 hours.
        - 72 is somewhat arbitrary, but enough time for students to sleep and think about what they've done.
        - This creates dialog and teachable moments.
        - The assignment is given a zero, but no further disciplinary action is pursued.
        - If need be, additional support is sought if there are issues outside of class causing stress
      - time consuming
  - 0-10% of CS50 students still cross the line.
    - This happens in cases where code was undoubtedly copied.
      - The red flags are usually repeated odd english errors or peculiar variable names that are shared.
      - Software helps catch similarities.
      - Ultimately, human judgement decides when the line has been crossed.
