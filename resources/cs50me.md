# CS50.me

## What is it?

[**CS50.me**](https://CS50.me) is a grading and reporting platform for CS50. Both students and teachers log in to CS50.me using their [github](https://github.com) credentials. Students will have access to their grades for problems broken down into the axes of **Correctness**, **Design**, and **Style**.

## Brief Overview of Features
* *Correctness* is automatically graded when student uses submit50 to submit a finished problem through the CS50 IDE. These scores will populate for the respective problem in CS50.me. However, teachers have the ability to change grades if need be.

* *Style* is also automatically graded and populated when student uses submit50 to submit a finished problem through the CS50 IDE. Again, teachers have the ability to change grades if need be.

## Submission of Assignments and Grading
Each student enrolled in a section created by the teacher has access to their own gradebook. When a student submits code from their IDE using the `submit50` command, the assignment is automatically graded on the axes of **Correctness** and **Style**. These scores may be changed if the teacher so desires. This leaves only the **Design** aspect of the code to be scored by the teacher.

To aid in grading for **Design**, teachers may comment student submissions though CS50.me and github.
